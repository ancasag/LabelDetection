# LabelDetection

LabelDetection is a graphical tool that aims to facilitate all the steps required in the pipeline to construct and use a deep-learning base object detection model. This includes the functionality to annotate a dataset of images, train a model, and use it for prediction with new images. LabelDetection is based on the [LabelImg tool](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg), and its key features are:
- Facilitates the annotation of images.
- Detects objects using deep-learing based detection models trained with different algorithms and libraries. 
- Applies [Test time augmentation](https://github.com/ancasag/ensembleObjectDetection#test-time-augmentation-for-object-detection) to improve the performance of models.
- Generates the necessary code and folder structure to train a model using different algorithms. 
- Includes [data distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04440) in the training code to employ unlabelled images to construct the detection model. 
- Generates a report of the detected objects.

## Using detection models

LabelDetection can employ models trained with different algorithms and libraries to detect objects in the images. Currently, LabelDetection support algorithms trained with the following libraries:

## Test-time augmentation for object detection

Test-time augmentation (TTA) is an ensemble technique that can be applied to increase the performance of a model. This functionality is available thanks to the [ensemble repository](https://github.com/ancasag/ensembleObjectDetection) and can be applied to any model of those described in [using detection models](#using-detection-models).

![TestTimeAugmentation](images/testTimeAugm.jpg)


### Ensemble Options
Three different voting strategies can be applied for TTA:
*   Affirmative. This means that whenever one of the techniques that produce the initial predictions says that a region contains an object, such a detection is considered as valid.
*   Consensus. This means that the majority of the initial methods must agree to consider that a region contains an object. The consensus strategy is analogous to the majority voting strategy commonly applied in ensemble methods for images classification.
*   Unanimous. This means that all the methods must agree to consider that a region contains an object.

## Training new models

From an annotated folder, LabelDetection generates all the code required to train a new model. The generated code is available in the form of a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that can be run locally, provided that the user has a GPU, or using [Google Colaboratory](colab.research.google.com/).

### Available models

Currently, LabelDetection can generate the code to train the following models:

- YOLO v3 models trained with the [Darknet library](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
- SSD512 models trained with the [MXNet library](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/detection.html).
- RetinaNet-Resnet50 models trained with [Keras](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet). 
- Mask-RCNN-Resnet50 models trained with [Keras](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN). 
- EfficientDet-B0 models trained with [Keras](https://github.com/joheras/EfficientDet). 
- FSAF-Resnet50 models trained with [Keras](https://github.com/joheras/FSAF).
- FCOS-Resnet50 models trained with [Keras](https://github.com/joheras/keras-fcos). 

All the models trained with the generated code can be latter employed for detection in LabelDetection. 

### Downloading datasets to Colab

There are several options to upload a dataset to Google Colaboratory:

#### Google Drive

1. Upload the zip file generated by LabelDetection to the main folder of Google Drive. 
2. Include the following code in two empty cells of the notebook:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

```bash
!mv /content/drive/My\ Drive/dataset.zip dataset.zip
!unzip dataset.zip
```


#### Dropbox

1. Upload the zip file generated by LabelDetection to Dropbox. 
2. Create and copy a Dropbox share link for the uploaded file. 
3. Include and execute the following instruction where ``dropbox-link`` must be replaced with the Drobpox link.

```python
!wget dropbox-link -O datasets.zip
!unzip datasets.zip
```

### Data distillation

Annotating a dataset of images might be a time-consuming task, but object detection models benefits when there are many annotated images. Therefore, LabelDetection incorporates to the training code the necessary functionality to apply a semi-supervised learning technique known as [data distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04440). This technique will employ both the annotated and unlabelled images to create the detection model. This technique can be applied with all the [available models](#available-models).

By default, the transformation techniques applied for data distillation are histogram normalization and vertical flips, but the user can employ any of the techniques described in [techniques for TTA](#techniques-for-tta).
